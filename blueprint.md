# AI-Powered Lotto Number Analyzer & Generator

## **Project Overview**

This project is an advanced lottery number analyzer and generator designed for the South Korean "Lotto 6/45". It leverages statistical analysis of historical draw data to provide users with number combinations that have a higher probability of winning.

## **Core Features**

- **Statistical Analysis Engine:** Analyzes the frequency of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th place winning numbers from historical draws (1 to 1212) to identify patterns.
- **Optimal Combination Generation:** Uses the statistical analysis to generate and recommend lottery number combinations.
- **Premium & Modern UI:**
  - Dark, energetic aesthetic using modern CSS (`oklch` colors, gradients).
  - Multi-layered drop shadows and subtle noise textures for a premium, tactile feel.
  - Interactive and animated "Lotto Ball" components for a dynamic user experience.
  - Fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop.
- **Technology:** Built with modern, framework-less web standards including Web Components, CSS Container Queries, and ES Modules.
- **Localization:** Native Korean language and context.

## **Current Task: Project Reframing**

**Objective:** Refocus the application from a "1212th Draw Analyzer" to a "Statistical Lotto Extractor" based on historical data from draws 1 through 1212.

**Plan:**
1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Modify the project overview and features to reflect the new statistical focus. (Done)
2.  **Update `index.html`:** Change all user-facing text (titles, headers, button labels) to align with the new functionality.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Remove any logic specific to the 1212th draw and prepare the script for implementing the new statistical analysis engine.
